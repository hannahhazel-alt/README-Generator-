# README-Generator-

Creating a README file using Node, Inquirer and JSON

## Description

This app uses node to generate a README.md file for the user. This means that the user just needs to answer questions in the terminal to generate this README.md file. This means that the user doesn't need to make one with the repo, they can use it here. During this project I learnt how to use node, how to write more functions to call two files together. I learnt how to use this '=>' with no errors and recognised how each function is suppose to talk to each other. I also learnt how to correct my work when an error message comes up within the terminal and that later versions of inquirer are a little easier to work with rather than the most recent.

## Installation

To use this you will need to git clone this repo to you computer, you will need to download the packages again using nmp i and to start the questions all you need to do is type in node index.js into the termianal opened into your code editor. This will allow you to run the code, answer the questions and generate a README.md file at the end.

## Usage

You can use this to help you generate a professional README.md file for your work. If you're constantly looking back and forth about what you need to add to the README this app will help you. It addes in step by step what you need with prompts.
